        In 2015/16 season, Liecester city became the first team to win English premier league outside traditional top six clubs in 20 years! A record yet to be broken. This is about how one of the greatest underdog story unfolded and how it was almost impossible to achieve.

          The way the league works is simple: 20 teams play against each other, at home and away, adding up to 38 matches in total. You get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss, and the team with the most points at the end of the season wins. Unlike in American sports, there are no playoffs in the Premier League. This means that a team can't make it to the playoffs, then catch fire and take the trophy home. No one wins the Premier League by luck or by going on a hot streak at just the right time. They win by being consistently the best over the course of a year. It's not at all unusual for an underdog team to get off to a great start, before eventually dropping down the table as their good form inevitably wears off. It's a long and psychologically grueling season, and it's difficult to keep up the same level over a year, especially once star players get injuries. Over the course of an entire season, the top teams rise to where they belong. 

          <br>

          <p id="demo"></p>

          A team can easily finish last despite beating the eventual champions. Imagine if the Miracle on Ice players had to play in a league over an entire year - would they finish above the Soviet Union? A title-winning team needs not just to have star players, but also a sufficiently deep squad so that other top quality players can step in when the stars are injured. This is why "little" teams simply do not win the league.

      In the remarkable 2015/16 Premier League season, Leicester City defied all odds, emerging as the ultimate underdog success story in the football world. Their triumph shattered the stronghold of traditional top six clubs, a feat unparalleled in two decades. The season's dynamics were straightforward - 20 teams competed with each other in a home-and-away format, accumulating points from wins and draws, with no playoffs. Leicester City's victory was a testament to consistent excellence throughout the year, a stark contrast to fleeting lucky streaks. Despite facing financial and squad depth disadvantages against major contenders, Leicester City stood resilient, fortified by a robust defense, led by captain Wes Morgan and the impressive N'golo Kante. They excelled in interceptions, tackles, and lethal counter-attacks, epitomized by their star striker Jamie Vardy, whose astonishing 18 non-penalty goals far surpassed the expected goal metric of 8, encapsulating their phenomenal journey to the top.
