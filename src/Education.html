 This Institute and the program not only provided a strong academic foundation but also honed my problem-solving skills. During this time, I worked on designing and developing crucial components for a drone surveillance system. This involved creating schematics, developing PCBs for essential systems like Battery Management and Electronic Speed Controllers, and engineering flight controller PCBs with specific communication interfaces.        </div>
